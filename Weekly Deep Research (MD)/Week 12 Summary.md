# Thesis Review Summary  

To wrap up, our portfolio strategy for **Week 10** remains focused on catalyst-driven alpha, balanced by tightened risk controls. We have repositioned the portfolio for upcoming inflection points.  

---

## Core Holdings  

### **aTyr Pharma (ATYR)**  
- Continues to be a cornerstone due to the transformative potential of **efzofitimod’s Phase 3 results**.  
- Trimmed the stake to protect gains and reduce binary risk exposure.  
- **High conviction:** if positive, ATYR could be a game-changer (large unmet market).  
- **Risk management:** hedged downside to ensure portfolio outperformance vs. the S&P 500 even in a negative scenario.  

### **Abeona Therapeutics (ABEO)**  
- Now a **commercial-stage company** with an FDA-approved therapy and >2 years of cash runway.  
- Patiently holding unless technicals force an exit.  
- Thesis: capitalize on **RDEB gene therapy approval** and potentially attract acquisition interest.  
- Watching upcoming conference updates for launch traction.  
- Along with ATYR, forms the **“backbone” of the portfolio**:  
  - ATYR → near-term catalyst.  
  - ABEO → medium-term commercial ramp.

## Tactical Positions  

### **Fortress Biotech (FBIO)**  
- Approaching binary **FDA catalyst at month’s end**.  
- Increased exposure: approval + PRV sale could significantly boost value.  
- A calculated, event-driven risk consistent with alpha mandate.  

### **4D Molecular Therapeutics (FDMT)**  
- Already delivered on initial thesis (positive data, stock rebound).  
- Now a longer-term bet on **ophthalmology gene therapy**.  
- Strong balance sheet (~$417M cash) + **fast-tracked Phase 3 trials**.  
- Acts as a **“life jacket”** in a sea of binary risks: intrinsic value + multiple shots on goal.  
- Plan to hold through Q4 milestones unless fundamentals shift.

## Opportunistic Bet  

### **Soligenix (SNGX)**  
- New addition with **exciting early data** and tiny float.  
- Small allocation = minimal risk, high upside optionality.  
- Treated as an **opportunistic trade** (momentum play), not a long-term hold.  
- Adds tactical “spice” to boost returns.

## Performance Recap  

- After **9 weeks**, portfolio is **up ~35%** vs. S&P’s **~6%**.  
- The coming week is **crucial**:  
  - **Successful aTyr readout** → potential major upside.  
  - **Failure scenario** → cuts into outperformance, but portfolio still retains substantial lead due to:  
    - Gains already banked.  
    - Diversification across catalysts and risk tiers.
